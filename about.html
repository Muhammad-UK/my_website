      <h3>Career</h3>
      <p>
        Currently working as a cashier for the grocery store, Woodman's Food
        Market, I want to take my love for problem-solving and computers and
        pursue a more applicable line of work.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, problem-solving and computers are a core part of who
        I am, and my hobbies are no different. I enjoy playing video-games that
        challenge my problem-solving skills- while still finding plenty of
        entertainment value of course.
